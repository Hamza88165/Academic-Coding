<h1> exercice 3:</h1>
<p class="p2">A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, 
	and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer
	than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs
	This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, 
	and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.
